                <h2>Polaris Space Hotel consisted of a spinning habitation ring around a central hub, providing artificial spin gravity for its guests and crew.
                    The rotating ring consisted of a continuous hallway with 4 elevators to the hub and modules attached to the side facing Earth.
                    These modules were used for the guest rooms and other hotel facilities, as well as for the flight deck, the control room of the station.
                    The hub was where the shuttles docked, and also featured a zero-G activity dome. The hotel offered features like a restaurant & event room with bar, 2 caf√©s, room service, and a fitness center.</h2>

                <h3>PHOENIX INTERPLANETARY SPACESHIP</h3>
                <h2> Phoenix was a Converted Spacecraft of Polaris Space Hotel as the Joint Mission with Polaris Travel Aerospace. 
                    Phoenix used their in-house developed "Osprey-methane" engines, which they attached to the former Polaris space station. 
                    As a former space hotel, the habitation modules of Phoenix are very spacious and could probably crew dozens of personnel. 
                    Beside the habitation ring and the propulsion modules, Phoenix has a Mars Surface Access Module (MSAM) called Popeye to transfer personnel and cargo between the mothership in orbit and the Martian surface. 
                    The habitation ring itself contains the ship's bridge and has its former hotel rooms repurposed for crew quarters, a dining room, a med bay, and several research modules. One module is serving as hydroponic garden to grow fresh food during the voyage and the time spent in orbit over Mars. 
                    Several landing pods for one-way use, containing all the important gear to bring down to the Martian surface like 2 mobile HAB rovers, a crawler type rover, 2 drills, and all the equipment for fuel generation and scientific experiments on Mars, are attached to the front of the habitation ring. </h2>
